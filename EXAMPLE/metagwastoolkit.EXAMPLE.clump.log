[1m* Description:  Perform a meta-analysis of genome-wide association studies. It will do the following:[00m
[1m                - Automatically parse the various cohort files.[00m
[1m                - Harmonize GWAS datasets relative to a reference.[00m
[1m                - Perform QC on GWAS datasets using user-defined settings.[00m
[1m                - Produce plots (PDF and PNG) for quick inspection and publication.[00m
[1m                - Run a meta-analysis using Random, Fixed, and Z-score methods.[00m
[1m                - Correct results for the genomic inflation factor.[00m
[1m                - Clump results based on a p-value threshold for downstream (meta-)analyses.[00m
[1m                - Produce plots (PDF and PNG) of the final meta-analysis results for publication.[00m
[1m                - Produce LocusZoom style regional plots for genome-wide significant hits.[00m
[1m                - Produce a ReadMe file.[00m
